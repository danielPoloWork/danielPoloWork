### About me
I hold a degree as an IT expert chief technician. With over five years of experience in developing websites and web applications (CRM, ERP), and nearly a year in industrial ERP development, I am dedicated to continuously enhancing my skills. Innovation drives my passion for IT, and I believe it is crucial for the advancement of modern companies.

I thrive in collaborative environments where everyone is encouraged to improve and excel. My colleagues describe me as sincere, tenacious, motivated, dedicated, authoritative, and extremely self-critical. These traits have helped me earn mutual respect with my colleagues. I am committed to hard work and achieving my goals.

### Motivation
> "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." 孔夫子 (Confucius)

I am driven by new challenges and the opportunity for continuous growth. This is why I love the IT field. Although my technical skills are constantly evolving, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully and demonstrate my value.

Kind regards,
*Daniel Polo*
