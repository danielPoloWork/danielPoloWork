# About me
My name is Daniel, and I graduated as an IT expert chief technician in the industrial sector. Despite having just over three years of experience in software development for websites or web applications (CRM, ERP) and less than one year in industrial ERP development, I am always striving to enhance my skills. I am drawn to the vision of innovation that pervades the IT field, a vision I endorse and consider essential for the advancement of modern companies.

I find it enjoyable to work in close-knit teams in a context of equal experiences, where everyone is encouraged to improve and do their best. I have been described as a sincere, tenacious, motivated, dedicated, authoritarian and extremely self-critical person, which has led to mutual esteem with some of my colleagues. I work hard and I like to achieve my goals.

I am motivated by new challenges and the opportunity to grow constantly, which is why I love the IT field. I am grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my value, aware that I bring certain technical skills that are not yet complete but always in a growth phase. If you are interested, you can view my Leetcode profile.

Kind regards, Daniel Polo
