### About me
I'm an IT expert and chief technician with a degree. I've been developing websites and web apps (CRM, ERP) for over five years and have nearly a year of experience in industrial ERP development. I'm always looking to improve my skills. I'm passionate about IT and believe it's crucial for modern companies to innovate.

I thrive in collaborative environments where everyone is encouraged to improve and excel. My colleagues say I'm sincere, tenacious, motivated, dedicated, authoritative, and extremely self-critical. These traits have helped me earn the respect of my colleagues. I'm committed to hard work and achieving my goals.

### Competence
I consider myself a junior software developer who can handle the design, installation, testing, and maintenance of software systems. I've got my hands on a lot of different platforms, languages, and frameworks.

I can manage my own projects and work well with others on a team. I have a forward-thinking vision and am passionate about making the world a more unified and connected place.

As a creative thinker, I'm good at software development and working with different data structures. I've shown I can pick up any computer software program or office storage system quickly and easily.

### Traits
I'm great at keeping things organized and I'm always motivated to get great results. I’m really dedicated and I always try to give the best service I can.

I’m up for new challenges and I’m happy to use my skills for more than just my own profit. I'm always willing to help others, often going above and beyond what's expected. I find that being busy often leads to higher productivity and greater satisfaction.

I'm ready and willing to meet the goals I've set for myself and to do my job well. My motivation is what drives me to be a reliable and satisfied worker. Sometimes, a pat on the back from my colleagues or superiors, a steady paycheque for my family, or just the knowledge that I can kick back after work is enough to keep me going.

### Philosophy
I’m really curious and have a strong desire to try new things that fall within my interests. Sometimes I look for new challenges just because I’m curious or because I want to learn or grow.

I'm good at looking at my own work and seeing what I can do better. I know when I've done a good job and where I can improve. I can take constructive criticism in stride and take pride in my commitment to my work.

Sometimes I can be quite empathetic, and I can see where my colleagues are coming from, whether they're celebrating a success or facing a challenge. If a colleague is going through a rough patch in their personal life, I try to be there for them, offering advice and listening.

I’m a natural leader and mentor. I honed these skills as an assistant martial arts instructor teaching kids between 4 and 12 years old. I was known for my empathy and kindness.

I'm pretty good at adapting to different social situations and making them work for me. I like to get along with my colleagues so we can all work together more easily.

### Motivation
I'm driven by new challenges and the chance to keep growing. That’s why I love the IT field. My technical skills keep evolving, but I know I can make a meaningful contribution and show what I can do.

Kind regards,
*Daniel Polo*
