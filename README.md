# About me
Let me introduce my self, 

my name is Daniel and I graduated as a "IT expert chief technician" for the industrial sector. Despite knowing that I have just over three years
of experience in the field of software development of websites and web applications (CRM, ERP) but less than one year in the field of industrial ERP development, I always
try to improve my skills. I am attracted by the vision of innovation that shines through IT field, a vision I agree and consider necessary in the development of a modern
company.

I find it enjoyable to work in close-knit teams in a context of equal experiences, where everyone is encouraged to improve and do your best. I have been described
as a sincere, tenacious, motivated, dedicated, authoritarian and extremely self-critical person, characteristics that have marked mutual esteem with some of my 
colleagues. I work hard and I like to achieve my goals.

I like new challenges as well as the opportunity to grow constantly and that's why I love the IT field. I always appreciate having the opportunity to demonstrate my
value, aware of bringing with me a certain technical baggage that is not complete but always in a growth phase.

*"Hard work pays off in the long run. Procrastination pays off."*
